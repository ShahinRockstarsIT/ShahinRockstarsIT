    <h1>Apple Pay Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The following terms and conditions ("Terms") are an agreement between you and Card Issuer that governs your access to and use of your Card through Apple Pay. By registering to add Card for use in Apple Pay on your Apple Devices, or allowing another cardholder to add a Card linked to your Card Account for use in Apple Pay on their Apple Devices, you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted all of the Terms contained herein and to use your Card in accordance with these Terms. If you do not agree with any of the following Terms, you must cease all access to, or use of your Card in connection with, Apple Pay and/or remove any Card linked to your account from Apple Pay.</p>

    <p>These Terms shall be read in conjunction and in addition with the Terms and Conditions of Payment Cards ("Agreement") which are available at http://www.mooguul.com/ and associated with Card. It is important that you read these Terms and the Agreement together. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of these Terms and the Agreement relating to your access to or use of Card through Apple Pay, the provisions of these Terms shall prevail.</p>

    <p>You also acknowledge that your use of Apple Pay is subject to the terms and conditions set forth by Apple with respect to the use of Apple Pay, which will not change or override these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Eligibility / Enrollment</h2>
    <p>Apple Pay is available to Card cardholders for the purposes of purchasing goods and services with an eligible Apple Device at near field communication ("NFC") enabled merchants and/or an online merchant, who accepts Apple Pay as a form of payment.</p>

    <p>To add your Card to Apple Pay, you must register your Card through Apple Pay via application or by directly scanning or entering the Card details manually on Apple Pay wallet ("Apple Pay Card Registration"). You may be required to take additional steps to authenticate yourself before your Card is added to Apple Pay, including providing the correct one-time password ("OTP") which will be sent to you by us via SMS on your registered mobile number with us ("Additional Authentication"). Your enrolment will be declined if the Card is not eligible for this service, you failed the authentication process, or if your Card or the underlying Card Account is not in good standing or conducted in a proper or satisfactory manner as determined by us at our absolute discretion.</p>

    <p>Apple Pay may also limit the number of Cards that you may store in a single Apple Device from time to time which we cannot control. We may, however, limit the number of Apple Devices in which the same Card can be stored from time to time and you should refer to our latest communications regarding such limit.</p>

    <p>For a Program Account which contains multiple Cards issuance, each Card shall be regarded as separate, and thus be subject to a separate Apple Pay Card Registration and Additional Authentication individually.</p>

    <p>By adding your Card to Apple Pay, a unique numerical identifier different from your Card number ("Device Card Number") will be allocated for the purpose of making purchases and receiving refunds through Apple Pay. Accordingly, you acknowledge that we have no control over the technology on your Apple Device, the availability, capability, verification method, security and integrity of the Apple Device and cannot be held responsible for transactions effected using Apple Pay and authorized using any biometric information or personal identification number or passcode. You should therefore assess if the Apple Device's manner of verification and risks associated with such use is acceptable to you.</p>

    <h2>Your use of Cards through Apple Pay</h2>
    <p>You must keep your Apple Device safe or secure, by locking it when not in use or when it is unattended and/or by installing up-to-date anti-malware or anti-virus software on it (wherever applicable), including ensuring that the device is not modified contrary to the software or hardware guidelines of the manufacturer or intentionally disabling the device's hardware or software controls (commonly referred to as "jailbreaking"). You acknowledge and agree that the use of a modified device to use your Card in connection with Apple Pay is expressly prohibited and is grounds for us to deny your access to your Card through Apple Pay.</p>

    <p>You must also ensure that your passcode or personal identification number that is required to allow you to use your Apple Device to access and use your Cards to make purchases through Apple Pay is kept secure in the same way as a cardholder would for a banking password or PIN, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not disclosing or sharing to any one;</li>
        <li>Not carrying a record of it with an Apple Device or anything liable to be stolen with an Apple Device (unless a reasonable effort is made to protect the security of the device);</li>
        <li>Not choosing an easily guessable passcode such as the cardholder's date of birth or a recognizable part of the cardholder's name; and</li>
        <li>Not acting with negligence in failing to protect the security of the passcode.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You must take all steps and prevent any fraud, loss or theft in respect of your Apple Device or any of your Card in connection with the use of Apple Pay.</p>

    <p>If biometric identifiers are registered on your Apple Device and are used to identify you or be used to grant access to and use your Card for Apple Pay, you must not save a third party's biometrics such as fingerprint (biometric information) on the device. In the event a third party's biometrics are saved on the device, whether now or in the future, and such biometric details can be used to grant access to the device to access and use your Card, you understand, acknowledge and agree that you will be taken to have authorized that person to transact on your behalf and the transactions will be charged to your Card, to which you shall be responsible and liable for the same.</p>

    <p>If you enroll for biometric verification such as fingerprint identity ("Touch ID"), personal identification number or passcode on Apple Pay, the collection, storage, enrolment and access to Apple Pay using your biometric information, personal identification number or passcode will be made using the technology on your Apple Device. Accordingly, you acknowledge that we have no control over the technology on the Apple Device, the availability, capability, verification method, security and integrity of the Apple Device and cannot be held responsible for transactions effected using Apple Pay and authorized using any biometric information or personal identification number or passcode. You should therefore assess if the Apple Device's manner of verification and risks associated with such use is acceptable to you.</p>

    <p>The use of Apple Pay is at your own discretion. You are not obliged to use Apple Pay in connection with any of your Card. Accordingly, you agree that the access and use of your Card through Apple Pay will be considered as authorized by you and you shall be responsible and liable for the same. If you share your passcode with any other person, you are taken to have authorized that person to transact on your account using Apple Pay. This means that any Apple Pay transaction initiated by that person using the fingerprint or passcode will be authorized by you and the clauses of the Agreement which deals with unauthorized transactions will not apply.</p>

    <p>If your Apple Device is lost or stolen, any biometric information or personal identification number or other passcode is compromised or used or your Card has been used through Apple Pay without your permission, you must notify us immediately and if we so require, furnish to us a statutory declaration in such form as we specify and/or a police report and/or any other information we may reasonably require. You are liable for all unauthorized use of your Card in connection with Apple Pay until you notify us unless we determined, at our sole discretion that: (i) you have fully complied with these Terms (including, but not limited to the safety precautions) and you notified us without delay, (ii) you assist in the investigations and recovery, and (iii) we are satisfied that such unauthorized transactions are not due to your wilful misconduct and/or gross negligence and that you have not acted fraudulently.</p>

    <p>You agree and acknowledge that the transaction history displayed in Apple Pay in connection with the use of your Card in Apple Pay solely represents our authorization of your Apple Pay transaction using that particular Apple Device and does not reflect any post-authorization activity, including but not limited to clearing, settlement, foreign currency exchange, refunds, returns or chargebacks. Accordingly, the purchase amount, currency, and other details for your Apple Pay transaction history in connection with use of your Card in Apple Pay may not match the transaction amount that is ultimately cleared, settled, and posted to your Card statement of account. If there is any inconsistency between your Card statement of account and transaction history displayed in Apple Pay, your Card statement of account shall prevail, and you will remain liable to us for the amounts set out on your statements.</p>

    <h2>Fees and charges</h2>
    <p>All applicable fees, interests and charges that apply to your Card pursuant to the Agreement are available and provided on our website and will continue to apply after you have registered your Card with Apple Pay. We currently do not impose any additional fees for using your Card through Apple Pay but we reserve the right to impose a fee at our sole discretion in the future. You shall be solely responsible for all third-party charges, such as your telecommunications carrier or provider may impose web-enablement, data usage or text messaging fees and/or other charges associated with your use of Apple Pay.</p>

    <p>As a condition of using your Card in connection with Apple Pay, you acknowledge and consent to us sending notifications and automatically dialed calls or text messages to the Apple Device which may or may not be the same device as your mobile phone number on record with us.</p>

    <h2>Suspension and Termination of Apple Pay</h2>
    <p>We have the right to suspend, block or cancel your ability to use your Card in connection with Apple Pay at any time and need not give you any prior notice or reason for doing so, including, modifying or suspending the type of transactions allowed on your Card in connection with Apple Pay, change the eligibility of a Card for use with Apple Pay, and/or change the Card authentication process.</p>

    <p>We also have the right to impose a limit on any daily and/or individual transaction amount(s) charged to your Card through Apple Pay. The limit will be at such amount(s) as determined by us and notified to you from time to time.</p>

    <p>In the event we have cancelled or suspended your Card in accordance with these Terms and/or the terms of the Agreement, you will not be allowed to use it through your Apple Device.</p>

    <p>Please note that this is the case even though you may still see a symbol for the Card on your Apple Device.</p>

    <h2>Authorization to collect and share data</h2>
    <p>You agree that we may collect, transmit, store, and use technical, location, and login or other information about you and your use of your Card through Apple Pay. We may also collect information relating to your Apple Device (including app version, device type and model, operating system and security information such as whether you have obtained root access):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To ensure your Card properly functions in Apple Pay;</li>
        <li>For security purposes and to identify fraud;</li>
        <li>For Reap to better provide assistance to you; and</li>
        <li>To tell you about other products or services that may be of interest to you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You acknowledge that (i) Apple, the provider of Apple Pay technology that supports your Card in Apple Pay, as well as its subcontractors, agents, and affiliates, and (ii) the applicable payment network branded on your Card (i.e., Visa) as well as subcontractors, agents, and affiliates of such payment networks, will have access to certain details of your transactions made with merchants via use of your Card through Apple Pay in and/or for the purposes of (1) performing its obligations hereunder; (2) providing you with relevant transaction data; (3) detecting and addressing fraud; (4) complying with applicable laws and regulations; (5) responding to inquiries made pursuant to court orders or by regulators; (6) managing, making product enhancement to, and/or promoting the use of Apple Pay; and (7) creating business and/or technical performance reporting.</p>

    <h2>Merchant relationships and disclaimers</h2>
    <p>Merchants may present to you certain discounts, rebates or other benefits (e.g. free shipping) ("Offers") if payment is effected through Apple Pay. Such Offers are subject to certain terms and conditions between you and the relevant merchant. We will not be liable for any loss or damage as a result of any interaction between you and a merchant with respect to such Offers.</p>

    <p>All matters, including delivery of goods and services, returns, and warranties, are solely between you and the applicable merchants. You acknowledge that we do not endorse or warrant the merchants that are accessible through Apple Pay or the Offers that they provide.</p>
